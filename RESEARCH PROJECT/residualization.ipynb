    "# Residualization Against Betting Odds: Calibrated Correction Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach: Uplift Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a **residual-learning** approach to upset prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Formula:\n",
    "```\n",
    "uplift = logit(P_actual) - logit(P_market)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- **P_market** = Betting odds probability (market's prediction)\n",
    "- **P_actual** = Actual outcome (1 if upset occurred, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "- **uplift** = The residual that captures where the market was wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preserves market efficiency as a prior** ✓\n",
    "   - Betting markets aggregate information from thousands of experts\n",
    "   - We don't discard this valuable signal\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Quantifies contextual factors the market misses** ✓\n",
    "   - Train model on non-odds features to predict uplift\n",
    "   - Identifies systematic market biases\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Avoids data leakage** ✓\n",
    "   - Model never uses odds to define the target\n",
    "   - Only uses pre-match observable features (rankings, stats, context)\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Interpretable insights** ✓\n",
    "   - SHAP values reveal when/why market underestimates underdogs\n",
    "   - Can identify surface-specific, player-style, or tournament biases\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow:\n",
    "1. Calculate market probabilities from betting odds\n",
    "2. Compute uplift = logit(actual) - logit(market)\n",
    "3. Train model on engineered features to predict uplift\n",
    "4. Combine: P_final = inverse_logit(logit(P_market) + uplift_predicted)\n",
    "5. Evaluate if we beat the market's predictions"
