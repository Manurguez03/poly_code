# 🎾 Predicting Tennis Match Upsets Using Machine Learning Approaches
#HOLAAA 

## 📘 Project Overview
Unexpected outcomes — known as *upsets* — are among the most fascinating aspects of professional tennis.  
This project investigates when and why lower-ranked players defeat higher-ranked opponents using **machine learning** and **data-driven analysis**.  

We use publicly available **ATP match data** from [Jeff Sackmann’s Tennis repository](https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp) to build predictive models that identify contextual and performance-based factors associated with upsets.

---

## 🧠 Motivation
While player rankings are strong indicators of performance, they fail to explain the many matches where lower-ranked players win.  
Understanding the conditions that lead to upsets can provide valuable insights for:
- **Coaches** – improving match preparation and strategy  
- **Analysts** – developing data-driven commentary  
- **Fans** – deepening appreciation for the sport’s unpredictability  

---

## 🎯 Goals
1. Define and detect **upset matches** based on player rankings and betting odds.  
2. Identify **key performance and contextual factors** (surface, fatigue, momentum, etc.) that contribute to upsets.  
3. Compare multiple **machine learning models** for predicting upsets.  
4. Address **class imbalance**, since upsets are much rarer than standard outcomes.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Data Source
- ATP match data (1998–2024) compiled by **Jeff Sackmann**  
- Includes player stats, rankings, tournament info, surfaces, and match outcomes  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Cleaned and merged yearly CSVs (2016–2024)
- Handled missing values and standardized player identifiers  
- Engineered new features: serve efficiency, return points, head-to-head history, surface performance, and momentum indicators  

### 3. Defining the Target Variable
An **upset** occurs when:
- A **lower-ranked** player defeats a **higher-ranked** opponent  
  (future versions may also incorporate implied probabilities from betting odds)

### 4. Models Used
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **XGBoost**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  

These models were selected for their interpretability and strong performance in previous tennis prediction research:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

### 5. Evaluation Metrics
To account for the class imbalance between upsets and non-upsets:
- **F1-score** and **Recall** (main metrics)  
- **Confusion Matrix** (for detailed error analysis)  
- **Accuracy** and **Precision** (secondary metrics)

---

## 📊 Results Summary
- The Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved the best predictive performance.  
- Serve strength, break-point conversion, surface type, and player momentum emerged as **key predictors** of upset likelihood.  
- The models demonstrated meaningful predictive power beyond rankings alone, suggesting that upsets follow identifiable patterns.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges
- **Class imbalance**: Upsets are rare events, making balanced prediction difficult.  
- **Missing or inconsistent data** for lower-ranked players.  
- **Psychological factors** like momentum and confidence are hard to quantify.  
- **Temporal dynamics** — players’ performance changes over time.

---

## 📈 Future Work
- Integrate **betting-odds-based definitions** of upsets for probabilistic modeling.  
- Use **time-aware cross-validation** to handle temporal dependencies.  
- Incorporate **real-time match data** for in-play upset prediction.  
- Explore **model interpretability** tools such as SHAP values and feature importance visualization.
